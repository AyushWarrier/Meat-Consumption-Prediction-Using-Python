# Meat-Consumption-Prediction-Using-Python

*This project was created during my **4th semester of 2nd year** for the subject **Foundations of Data Warehousing and Data Mining**. It focuses on predicting **India’s future meat consumption** using **Linear Regression**.*

## About the Project  
This project analyzes **historical meat consumption data (1961-2021)** and forecasts future trends (2022-2032).  
- **Machine Learning Model Used**: Linear Regression  
- **Dataset Source**: Kaggle  
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  

## Project Structure  
- `Report/` 📄 – Contains the **final project report**  
- `Code/` 🐍 – Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction  
- `Dataset/` 📊 – The dataset used for training the model  
- `Visualizations/` 📈 – Graphs and charts showing results

## Getting-Started

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AyushWarrier/Meat-Consumption-Prediction-Using-Python.git
cd Meat-Consumption-Prediction-Using-Python
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### **3. Run the Code**
```sh
python model.py
```
This will train the model and generate **future predictions**.
